His parents were very hard-working\nand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\nchildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\nin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\ncharacter.\n\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\nfinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\nalready begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”\n\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\nwas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\ninstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\nseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\nwas arrested.\n\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\nwas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\nand Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against\nthe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas\nI. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\nus our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\n\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\nnever regained his sanity.\n\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\nDostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\nhe began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary\nbattalion.\n\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started\nanother journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\n\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\n\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\nvast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a\nking.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\n\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\ninspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\nbecame great.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\n\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\n\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\nslip out unseen.\n\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\naware of his fears.\n\n“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\ntrifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\ntoo much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\nfood.\n\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met wi\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The Task\n\nSo we have some text. Cool. What's the task though? Well, since this is easy to get and I wanted to reup my game on using the Trainer API from Hugging Face, text classification seems good enough for me.

I know everything.” “No, you may say what you like, prince, there’s the interest of their institutions,” said the colonel. “But what is there interesting about it? They’re all as pleased as brass halfpence. They’ve conquered everybody, and why am I to be pleased at that? I haven’t conquered anyone; and I’m obliged to take off my own boots, yes, and put them away too; in the morning, get up and dress at once, and go to the dining-room to drink bad tea! How different it is at home! You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble a little, and come round again. You’ve time to think things over,\n\nhim at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, “Thy day!” I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted\n\nthat was lying on the table. ‘Here it is! You did not write it yourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don’t even know French, you fool.’ And what do you think? ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.’ ‘If that’s so, you’re a traitor and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll be hanged! Say from whom you had it.’ ‘I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.’ And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman’s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for\n\nsaid. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘if that cart were to move on a little, would it break the goose’s neck or not?’ ‘It’d be sure to break it,’ and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted. ‘Come on, then,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’ ‘Let’s,’ he said. And it did not take us long to arrange: he stood at the bridle without being noticed, and I stood on one side to direct the goose. And the owner wasn’t looking, he was talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself, under the cart, just under the wheel. I winked at the lad, he tugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose’s neck was broken in half. And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. ‘You\n\nis the matter?” “What I have said a thousand times over, and can’t help thinking ... that I’m not worthy of you. You couldn’t consent to marry me. Think a little. You’ve made a mistake. Think it over thoroughly. You can’t love me.... If ... better say so,” he said, not looking at her. “I shall be wretched. Let people say what they like; anything’s better than misery.... Far better now while there’s still time....” “I don’t understand,” she answered, panic-stricken; “you mean you want to give it up ... don’t want it?” “Yes, if you don’t love me.” “You’re out of your mind!” she cried, turning crimson with vexation. But his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and flinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside him. “What are you thinking? tell me all.” “I am thinking you can’t love me. What can you\n\ndespair. He lighted a candle, got up cautiously and went to the looking-glass, and began looking at his face and hair. Yes, there were gray hairs about his temples. He opened his mouth. His back teeth were beginning to decay. He bared his muscular arms. Yes, there was strength in them. But Nikolay, who lay there breathing with what was left of lungs, had had a strong, healthy body too. And suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children, and how they only waited till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fyodor Bogdanitch could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life and happiness. “And now that bent, hollow chest ... and I, not knowing what will become of me, or wherefore....” “K...ha! K...ha! Damnation! Why do you\n\nwhile the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left. The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one’s children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results. “It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away from Moscow,” they were told. In his\n\nhe asked. ‘Do you see that cart full of oats?’ I said. ‘The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up—do you see?’ ‘I see that quite well,’ he said. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘if that cart were to move on a little, would it break the goose’s neck or not?’ ‘It’d be sure to break it,’ and he grinned all over his face, highly delighted. ‘Come on, then,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’ ‘Let’s,’ he said.

How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.” Her brother shook his head incredulously. “The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is Father’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.” “Ah! my\n\nyears or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: ‘What are you being punished for, Daddy?’—‘I, my dear brothers,’ said he, ‘am being punished for my own and other men’s sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much\n\non his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through! It’s true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he. And now—this duel! Have these people no feeling, or honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! It’s well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who doesn’t have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months. And then to call him out, reckoning on Fédya not fighting because he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand Fédya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few people do understand him. He\n\nthe first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture with her. “If only it were possible for me to see her once more! Just once, looking into those eyes to say...” “Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!” flopped the fly.... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door.\n\nsilent on her chair, said suddenly, and she hid her eyes in her handkerchief. “Buffoon!” blurted out the girl at the window. “Have you heard our news?” said the mother, pointing at her daughters. “It’s like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again. When we were with the army, we used to have many such guests. I don’t mean to make any comparisons; every one to their taste. The deacon’s wife used to come then and say, ‘Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart, but Nastasya Petrovna,’ she would say, ‘is of the brood of hell.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘that’s a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.’ ‘And you want keeping in your place,’ says she. ‘You black sword,’ said I, ‘who asked you to teach me?’ ‘But my breath,’ says she, ‘is clean, and yours is unclean.’ ‘You ask all\n\nbut with secret malevolence in their hearts. “Once again, Colonel,” said the general, “I can’t leave half my men in the wood.

Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasíli said in a whisper: “I know for a fact that Kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the Tsarévich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the Emperor?” And Prince Vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by Kutúzov to the Emperor. “I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right.” “Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutúzov! I have known him a long time!” “They even say,” remarked the “man of great merit” who did not yet possess courtly tact, “that his excellency made it an express condition\n\nthe baby, of Stiva, but it was obvious that nothing interested Anna. “I came to say good-bye to you,” she said, getting up. “Oh, when are you going?” But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty. “Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,” she said with a smile. “I have heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband. He came to see me, and I liked him exceedingly,” she said, unmistakably with malicious intent. “Where is he?” “He has gone back to the country,” said Kitty, blushing. “Remember me to him, be sure you do.” “I’ll be sure to!” Kitty said naïvely, looking compassionately into her eyes. “So good-bye, Dolly.” And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty, Anna went out hurriedly. “She’s just the same and just as charming! She’s very lovely!” said Kitty, when she was alone with her sister. “But there’s something\n\nthe highest circles, and here too your behaviour has hitherto been a model, which has been a great consolation to your mother, who is so precious to all of us....

All at once there was a gleam of something sly and mocking in his eyes. \"I'll tell you what drives me to it,\" he said sullenly, and looking round him he bent down to Ivan Ossipovitch's ear. The refined Alyosha Telyatnikov\n\na general feeling of irritation, a feeling of implacable resentment; every one seemed thoroughly disgusted with everything. A kind of bewildered cynicism, a forced, as it were, strained cynicism was predominant in every one. The only people who were free from bewilderment were the ladies, and they were clear on only one point: their remorseless detestation of Yulia Mihailovna. Ladies of all shades of opinion were agreed in this. And she, poor dear, had no suspicion; up to the last hour she was persuaded that she was \"surrounded by followers,\" and that they were still \"fanatically devoted to her.\" I have already hinted that some low fellows of different sorts had made their appearance amongst us. In turbulent times of upheaval or transition low characters always come to the front everywhere. I am not speaking now of the so-called \"advanced\" people who are always in a hurry to be in\n\nat the exact time!... Well, what do you say to the Montenegrins now? They’re a race of warriors.” “Why, what’s happened?” asked Levin. Katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war, and going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of pleasant appearance. This was Metrov. The conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in Petersburg. Metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers. Katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite different. Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped. “Yes, here he’s written almost a book\n\njarring sound. “Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,” came the old countess’ voice from the drawing room. Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natásha, Nicholas, and Sónya, remarked: “How quiet you young people are!” “Yes, we’re philosophizing,” said Natásha, glancing round for a moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing dreams. Dimmler began to play; Natásha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table, took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly in her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else. “Do you know,” said Natásha in a whisper, moving\n\nand her governess rose. He patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew. The men remained at table over their port—English fashion. In the midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon’s Spanish affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to express a contrary opinion. Speránski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few moments all were silent. Having sat some time at table, Speránski corked a bottle of wine and, remarking, “Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,” passed it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed to Speránski and he\n\nroubles; you need not count them. Take them,” Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes. Ivan sank back in his chair. He was as white as a handkerchief. “You frightened me ... with your stocking,” he said, with a strange grin. “Can you really not have known till now?” Smerdyakov asked once more. “No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother, brother! Ach!” He suddenly clutched his head in both hands. “Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother’s help or without?” “It was only with you, with your help, I killed him, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.” “All right, all right. Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? I can’t speak properly.” “You were bold enough then. You said ‘everything was lawful,’ and how frightened you are now,” Smerdyakov muttered in surprise. “Won’t you have some lemonade?

Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch kept turning round, looking about him, answering nobody, and glancing curiously at the persons exclaiming around him. At last he seemed suddenly, as it were, to sink into thought again--so at least it was reported--frowned, went firmly up to the affronted Pyotr Pavlovitch, and with evident vexation said in a rapid mutter: \"You must forgive me, of course... I really don't know what suddenly came over me... it's silly.\" The carelessness of his apology was almost equivalent to a fresh insult. The outcry was greater than ever. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch shrugged his shoulders and went away. All this was very stupid, to say nothing of its gross indecency-- A calculated and premeditated indecency as it seemed at first sight--and\n\nlove me.” “Yes, I don’t say so either.... Only one thing. Tell me the truth,” said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand: “tell me, did Levin speak to you?...” The mention of Levin’s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige of self-control. She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp on the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said: “Why bring Levin in too? I can’t understand what you want to torment me for. I’ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and never, _never_ would I do as you’re doing—go back to a man who’s deceived you, who has cared for another woman. I can’t understand it! You may, but I can’t!” And saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of\n\nand bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and drinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery. And the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit, smashed trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and seemed to be asking—what more, and does the whole Russian spirit consist in just this? In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne. Vronsky was used to princes, but, either because he had himself changed of late, or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him. The whole of that week he experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman, afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from being with him, fearing for his own reason.\n\nShtcherbatskaya. “On Thursdays we are home, as always.” “Today, then?” “We shall be pleased to see you,” the princess said stiffly. This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother’s coldness. She turned her head, and with a smile said: “Good-bye till this evening.” At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero. But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly’s health. After a little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out his chest again, and put his arm in Levin’s. “Well, shall we set off?” he asked. “I’ve been thinking about you all this time, and I’m very, very glad you’ve come,” he said, looking him in the face with a significant air.\n\nbit, too, and consider for yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to those enemies, ‘No, I’m not a Christian, and I curse my true God,’ then at once, by God’s high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?” He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch’s questions, and was well aware of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions. “Ivan,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, “stoop down for me to whisper. He’s got this all up for your benefit. He wants you\n\nin which five beds now stood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, stout Nesvítski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkónski was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Borís. The one who was writing and whom Borís addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkónski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him. Borís thanked him and went to the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals. When\n\nthat is not subject to reason. If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable. A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments. Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards, a man indubitably\n\nlady of the house grumbled indignantly. \"No, I will have my say,\" said the major hotly, addressing Stavrogin. \"I reckon on you, Mr. Stavrogin, as a fresh person who has only just come on the scene, though I haven't the honour of knowing you. Without men they'll perish like flies--that's what I think. All their woman question is only lack of originality. I assure you that all this woman question has been invented for them by men in foolishness and to their own hurt. I only thank God I am not married. There's not the slightest variety in them, they can't even invent a simple pattern; they have to get men to invent them for them! Here I used to carry her in my arms, used to dance the mazurka with her when she was ten years old; to-day she's come, naturally I fly to embrace her, and at the\n\nmind that there were political manifestoes, and that Shpigulins' factory hands were being incited to a Socialist rising, and that he was so persuaded of it that he would perhaps have regretted it if the story had turned out to be nonsense. \"He wants to get distinction in Petersburg,\" our wily Ilya Ilyitch thought to himself as he left Von Lembke; \"well, that just suits me.\" But I am convinced that poor Andrey Antonovitch would not have desired a rebellion even for the sake of distinguishing himself. He was a most conscientious official, who had lived in a state of innocence up to the time of his marriage. And was it his fault that, instead of an innocent allowance of wood from the government and an equally innocent Minnchen, a princess of forty summers had raised him to her level? I know almost for certain that the unmistakable symptoms of\n\nabove all—don’t lie.” “You mean about Diderot?” “No, not about Diderot. Above all, don’t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his vices, all from continual lying to other men and to himself.
